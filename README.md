Fun fact: The background image is of the famous "Pillars of Creation", part of the Eagle Nebula, just one of these pillars is 7 light years across! With one light covering a distance of 186,000 miles per second, try to wrap your head around how large 7 light years is. The Eagle Nebula is an interstellar nursery composed of hydrogen gas and dust and is where stars are formed.
